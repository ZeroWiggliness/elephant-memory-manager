Elephant Memory Manager - C/C++ memory allocator designed for games

This was originally developed by myself for my company Jury Rig Software Ltd between 2010 and 2016 and used in many, many games.  I am now releasing this to the public domain.  I cannot find the unit tests nor the code the for Goldfish tool but I might be able to find an exe.
